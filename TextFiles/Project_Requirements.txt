	design
		don't use public fields
		define and use at least one interface
		core / domain / business logic
		class library
		contains all business logic
		contains domain classes (customer, order, store, product, etc.)
		documentation with <summary> XML comments on all public types and members (optional: <params> and <return>)
		(recommended: has no dependency on UI, data access, or any input/output considerations)

	customer

		(optional: has a default store location to order from)
	
	order
		has a store location
		has a customer
		has an order time (when the order was placed)
		can contain multiple kinds of product in the same order
		rejects orders with unreasonably high product quantities
		(optional: some additional business rules, like special deals)

	location
		has an inventory
		inventory decreases when orders are accepted
		rejects orders that cannot be fulfilled with remaining inventory
		(optional: for at least one product, more than one inventory item decrements when ordering that product)
		product (etc.)

	user interface
		interactive console application
		has only display- and input-related code
		low-priority component, will be replaced when we move to project 1
		test
		at least 10 test methods
		focus on unit testing business logic; testing the console app is very low priority
